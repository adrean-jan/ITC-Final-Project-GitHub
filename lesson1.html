            <h2>Lecture 1: C# programming overview</h2>
            <p>C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming 
            language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications 
            that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately 
            familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. 
            <br><br>
            C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. C# provides language 
            constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to 
            create and use software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support 
            new workloads and emerging software design practices. At its core, C# is an 
            object-oriented language. You define types and their behavior.
            <br><br>
            C# programs run on .NET, a virtual execution system called the common language runtime 
            (CLR) and a set of class libraries. The CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the 
            common language infrastructure (CLI), an international standard. The CLI is the basis 
            for creating execution and development environments in which languages and libraries 
            work together seamlessly.</p>

            <h2>Lecture 2: Basic Syntax</h2>
            <p>Basic Syntax of C# programming language</p><br>
            <pre>
                <code>
                using System;

                namespace HelloWorld
                {
                    class Program
                    {
                        static void Main(string[] args)
                        {
                        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
                        // Output: Hello World!    
                        }
                    }
                }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <br>
            <h2>Example explained</h2>
            <p>
            <b>Line 1:</b> using System means that we can use classes from the System namespace.<br>
            <b>Line 2:</b> A blank line. C# ignores white space. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.<br>
            <b>Line 3:</b> namespace is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.<br>
            <b>Line 4:</b> The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.<br>
            <b>Line 5:</b> class is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program. 
            Every line of code that runs in C# must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Program.
            <b>Line 7:</b> Another thing that always appear in a C# program, is the Main method. Any code inside its 
            curly brackets {} will be executed. You don't have to understand the keywords before and after Main.<br>
            <b>Line 9:</b> Console is a class of the System namespace, which has a WriteLine() method that is used 
            to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World!".<br>
            <b>If you omit the using System line, you would have to write System.Console.WriteLine() to print/output text.</b><br>
            <b>Note:</b> Every C# statement ends with a semicolon ;.<br>
            <b>Note:</b> C# is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.<br>
            <b>Note:</b> Unlike Java, the name of the C# file does not have to match the class name, but they often do (for better organization). 
            When saving the file, save it using a proper name and add ".cs" to the end of the filename. 
            To run the example above on your computer, make sure that C# is properly installed.<br>

            <h2>Lecture 3: Data Types</h2>
            <p>Different types of data types and their syntax</p><br>
            <pre>
                <code>
                int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
                double myDoubleNum = 5.99D;  // Floating point number
                char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
                bool myBool = true;          // Boolean
                string myText = "Hello";     // String
                </code>
            </pre>
            <br>
            <p>
            <b>Data type</b> specifies the size and type of variable values. It is important to use the correct data type 
            for the corresponding variable; to avoid errors, to save time and memory, but it will also make your code 
            more maintainable and readable.<br>
            <b>Integer types</b> stores whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals. Valid types are int and long. 
            Which type you should use, depends on the numeric value. <br>
            <b>Floating point types</b> represents numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. 
            Valid types are float and double.<br>
            <b>Boolean data type</b> is declared with the bool keyword and can only take the values true or false.<br>
            <b>Char data type</b> is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c'.<br>
            <b>String data type</b> is used to store a sequence of characters (text). String values must be surrounded by double quotes.<br>
